# CQRS/ES best practices

Best practices, guidance, and anti-patterns to avoid when building an application following CQRS/ES principles.

## Guidance

### Define a schema for commands and events

> Services share schema and contract, not class.

Don't share types (i.e. .NET classes compiled into assemblies) as a way to express contracts in a messaging system.

Do define and share a schema and contract. Publish it for consumers to build their own internal representation of your data.

#### Examples

- [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/)
- [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)

## Read model

### Autonomous read model projections

Don't share data between projections.

Do use autonomous projectors responsible for their own data. Projectors should run independently, allowing them to track their own progress and be rebuilt as required.

### Projectors should never crash

Don't enforce consistency rules in your read model projection.

Do follow Postel's robustness principle:

> Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept.
